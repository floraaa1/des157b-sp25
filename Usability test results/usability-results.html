    <h1>Usability Test Results</h1>
    <h2>Three significant observations</h2>
    <article>
        <ul>
            <li>The typewriting effect attracted users' attention and set the tone effectively.</li>
            <li>Users were confused about the second scene and how the choices could influence the story.</li>
            <li>Users got distracted in the third scene and did not know how it related to the final results. </li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <h2>How the project can be improved</h2>
    <article>
        <p>First scene:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add more background animation effects to enhance the atmosphere, such as glitch lines or color
                distortion.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>Second scene:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add one more choice to ensure all elements are evenly aligned and visually balanced. </li>
            <li>Add a yellow highlight and a left-side triangle icon as a hover effect for each choice to enhance visual
                feedback and interactivity.</li>
            <li>When the user clicks the “Repair” button, the card will change to green. If the user selects “Discard,”
                the card will turn red, visually indicating the outcome of their choice.</li>
            <li>Add a scientist's voice recording to the scientist audio card to provide background context and deepen
                the narrative of the project.</li>
            <li>Enlarge the letter size in the letter from future human card. </li>
            <li>Change another way to interact with the AI-human love memory card.</li>
            <li>Rethink the narrative structure of the system report log to make it more coherent and meaningful.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>Third scene:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Add subtle sound effects to enhance the atmosphere and emphasize the weight of each choice</li>
            <li>redesign the UI of the choice buttons.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
        <p>Ending scene:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Make the data visualized: how user's choice will affect the ending.</li>
            <li>Write a concluding scene to complete the narrative to make the story more cohesive and complete.</li>
        </ul>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h2>Can users figure out how to navigate/interact with your project?</h2>
        <p>I added clear instructions and interactive buttons to help users navigate the project smoothly and understand how to interact with each part of the experience. </p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h2>Does the project impact the user the way you want it to?</h2>
        <p>The project does impact users the way I intended.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h2>What modifications need to be made to interactions, visuals or other elements of the project to make it stronger?</h2>
        <p>I will add more transition animations to enhance the overall flow and immersion of the experience. The button visuals in the third scene will be improved to make them more visually appealing and consistent with the interface design. In the ending scene, I'll animate the final results to better capture the user's attention and create a more impactful conclusion.</p>
