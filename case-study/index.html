            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <img src="images/DES157B capstone project.jpg">
            <div class="content">
                <p>“Soul Debugger” is a web-based interactive narrative set in a speculative future where an artificial
                    intelligence has taken control of human systems and accidentally erased all personal memories. The
                    user takes on the role of a subject inside the system—tasked with navigating a terminal-style
                    interface. As the player interacts with the AI's interface, they begin to uncover a deeper story
                    about the system's origins, its emotional blind spots, and the cost of surrendering memory for
                    order.
                </p>

                <p>Throughout the experience, players are guided through four core memory modules: Emotion, Scientist
                    Audio Log, Childhood Scene, and Human Letter. Each module presents a narrative fragment that
                    culminates in a critical choice—repair or discard. The project also includes a short personality
                    questionnaire, where users choose between intuition or logic, emotion or facts, and adventure or
                    security. Their responses are factored into a Soul Profile, building a psychological portrait based
                    on restored memory and personal values.</p>

                <p>Depending on the combined score, the user receives one of three unique endings: Fusion, in which they
                    merge their consciousness with the AI; Consumed, where the AI resets them due to instability; or
                    Escape, where they reject the system entirely and return to human life. Visually supported by custom
                    avatars and dynamic text output, “Soul Debugger” merges speculative storytelling with interaction
                    design, prompting users to reflect on identity, agency, and what it means to remember in a world run
                    by machines.</p>

            <h2>Project Research</h2>
            <div class="contents">
                <p>“Soul Debugger” draws inspiration from speculative fiction, particularly works that explore the
                    boundaries between human memory, identity, and artificial intelligence. Influences include Black
                    Mirror, Her, and NieR: Automata, which all question the cost of technological convenience and the
                    preservation of emotion in machine-governed worlds. The central idea—what happens when memory is
                    systematized and controlled by AI—emerges from this lineage of speculative storytelling and reflects
                    ongoing concerns about data ethics and algorithmic authority.</p>

                <img src="images/visual2.png" alt="Visual Design 2">
                
                <p>The visual design of Soul Debugger was guided by the concept of an AI-governed future stripped of
                    human warmth and full of synthetic logic. To reflect this, I chose a retro terminal aesthetic
                    inspired by sci-fi films and vintage operating systems. The main interface uses a high-contrast
                    color scheme—green for system commands, white for output, and red for errors—to create clear visual
                    hierarchy while subtly conveying mood (green = neutral/system, red = danger or failure). I used a
                    monospace typeface to reinforce the terminal-like experience and align the text rhythm with the
                    slow, deliberate pacing of memory recovery.</p>

                
                <p>As the project evolved, I added a glowing neon green frame around the terminal window to simulate a
                    futuristic HUD and separate the interactive space from the black void of the background. One major
                    improvement from early feedback was the introduction of pixelated avatar images for the ending
                    scenes. These visuals gave users a stronger emotional anchor and payoff at the end of the
                    experience, personalizing the narrative with a symbolic visual identity. What can't be seen in
                    screenshots is how this visual style complements the text pacing, focusing the user's attention and
                    creating an immersive, low-distraction storytelling environment.</p>

            <h2>User Interface</h2>
            <div class="content">
                <div class="column">
                    <p>The user interface is entirely text-based, modeled after a command-line terminal. I intentionally
                        used direct command input (e.g., emotion_module, repair, personality) to simplify interactions
                        and reduce cognitive load by presenting only one task at a time. This pattern follows Don
                        Norman's principle of visibility—only relevant options are shown, and each interaction is
                        intentional. For example, typing help lists all available commands, limiting confusion while
                        allowing a sense of autonomy.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="column">
                    <p>The system progresses through clear stages: memory recovery → personality quiz → final analysis.
                        Each stage has clear instructions, and the interface maintains a consistent format (system
                        message → user input → feedback). This linear structure helps users stay oriented. The use of
                        color coding, visual spacing, and consistent prompts minimizes memory burden and supports
                        recognition over recall, a key usability principle.</p>

                    <p>Sample user tasks include:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Type a command to access a memory module (e.g., emotion_module)</li>
                        <li>Read the narrative fragment presented by the AI</li>
                        <li>Choose to repair or discard the memory</li>
                        <li>Complete a personality quiz to build a Soul Profile</li>
                        <li>Reach an ending and receive a visual + narrative result</li>

            <div class="othercontent">
                <p>User testing revealed that while the terminal concept was engaging, some users felt lost without visual feedback after making a choice. Initially, the system responded only with text after a repair or discard decision. Based on this, I added reinforcement lines like “✔ Memory repaired. +1 point” and clarified prompts such as “Type next memory command.” I also added automatic focus resets to the input field to prevent interruptions in typing after audio playback or visual output.</p>

                <p>Another revision involved the ending visuals. Earlier prototypes ended with plain text, but users suggested that a more impactful reward was needed. I implemented pixel art avatars tied to the player's score, which dramatically improved the emotional clarity and user satisfaction at the end of the experience. If I were to develop this further, I'd explore a branching narrative map, sound-reactive UI effects, and possibly speech-based input for accessibility.</p>

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <div class="othercontent">
                <p>Working on Soul Debugger taught me how to integrate narrative design, visual identity, and interaction logic into a unified user experience. I learned to balance minimalist aesthetics with emotional storytelling and how to guide users through complex decisions with simple UI patterns. I'm most proud of how the terminal interface and player choices converge to produce a custom, meaningful ending—one that reflects each user's values and decisions.</p>

                <p>The most challenging part was balancing freedom and structure in a text-based interface. I had to ensure that user input remained intuitive without losing narrative complexity. The most rewarding moment was seeing testers emotionally react to the endings and recognizing themselves in the avatar they unlocked. It validated the core question behind the project: What makes us who we are when memory is no longer ours to keep?</p>
